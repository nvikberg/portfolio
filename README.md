## Written with JavaScript and React
### Nikolina Vikberg, Grit Academy Malmö


Assignment: Create a portfolio page with a startpage with gallery of your own projects (each project should have its own page) and an information page about you.


Link to pages: https://nvikberg.github.io/yhflex-htmlcss-slutprojekt-nikolina-vikberg/

How it works: 
On the home page, you can click on each project and it will open in a new page.
On the project page you can scroll down to see all the projects, you can hover over the images and they will enlarge.
The site is dynamic and will adjust based on users device.
